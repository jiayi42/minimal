# The ML models should be always updated to keep up with the drift. Otherwise, they will fail fake news detection soon. 
The main issue here is that the fake news mainly spreads in social media such as Twitter. The tweets on Twitter have three main attributes that make fake news detection difficult.

*   The tweets contain many unstructed contexts such as hashtags, emojis, stickers, and emoticons, which normally harm the detection performance.
*   The number of tweets is large, which requires the tweet collection and labeling process to be fast.
*   The topics of tweets are messy and changing swiftly.
