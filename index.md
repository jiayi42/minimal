# A COVID Fake News War
### COVID Fake News Data Is Always Drifting

The current fake news is about COVID. We try to shows the changing wordclouds of the keywords in LDA topic models from 2020 Feb. to 2020 Nov from COVID related articles the factcheck website. We ring the words which indeeds show the hot topics at that moment.

Therefore, it is important for us to recognize them.

### The ML models should be always updated to keep up with the drift. 
The main issue here is that the fake news mainly spreads in social media such as Twitter. The tweets on Twitter have three main problems that make fake news detection difficult.

*   The tweets contain many unstructed contexts such as hashtags, emojis, stickers, and emoticons, which normally harm the detection performance.
*   The number of tweets is large, which requires the tweet collection and labeling process to be fast.
*   The topics of tweets are more messy and changing more swiftly than the factcheck website.

We do not ring the words as we cannot recognize any obvious topics in LDA topic models in our labeled tweets data.

### Thus, we offer three solutions to the problems, respectively.

*   Data Cleaning
*   COVID Tweet Collection and Efficient Corroborative Labeling Process
*   The topics of tweets are more messy and changing more swiftly than the factcheck website.

## Let us start to fight against the ultimate evil of COVID Fake News on Twitter!
